## üí¨ Local Commit Message Linting (Husky + Commitlint)

To ensure a consistent Git history and enable automated versioning, this project enforces a local commit message validation system.

### Goal

This system solves two primary objectives:
1.  **Error Prevention:** It blocks commits with improperly formatted messages before they are even created in the repository.
2.  **Release Automation:** It guarantees that all commits merged into the main branch adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard, which our `release-please` tool relies on.

### How It Works

We use two main utilities:
-   **Husky**: Manages Git hooks. We use the `commit-msg` hook, which triggers every time you run `git commit`.
-   **Commitlint**: Validates the commit message against a defined set of rules.

The process is as follows:
`git commit` -> `Husky` intercepts the event -> `Husky` runs `Commitlint` -> `Commitlint` validates the message -> If the message is invalid, the commit is aborted.

### Developer Setup

To activate this system on your local machine, follow these one-time setup steps:
1.  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16+ is recommended).
2.  Run the following command in the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will download all necessary development tools and automatically configure the Git hooks.

### Rules and Testing Scenarios

The commit validation rules are configured in the `.commitlintrc.json` file. The scenarios below are based on the current configuration. **If you modify the rules in `.commitlintrc.json`, remember to update these examples!**

**Current Key Rules:**
1.  **`extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']`**: We inherit the base ruleset from Conventional Commits (requires a type, description, etc.). This includes:
    *   A mandatory type and subject.
    *   **A line length limit for the commit body (100 characters).**
2.  **`header-max-length: 72`**: The header line must not exceed 72 characters.
3.  **`scope-enum`**: The `scope` field must be one of the predefined values. This prevents typos and enforces consistency. The current list is: `project`, `activity`, `payment`, `activity-schema`, `payment-schema`.

#### ‚úÖ Examples of Valid Commits (will pass)

| Command                                                              | Explanation                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git commit -m "feat(payment): add support for credit cards"`        | A new feature (`feat`) within an allowed scope (`payment`).                     |
| `git commit -m "fix(project): correct typo in config"`               | A bug fix (`fix`) within an allowed scope (`project`).                          |
| `git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"`                    | A commit without a `scope` (which is allowed by the standard).                  |
| `git commit -m "refactor!: drop support for legacy API"`             | A commit with a `BREAKING CHANGE` (indicated by `!`).                           |

#### ‚ùå Examples of Invalid Commits (will be blocked)

| Command                                                                | Reason for Failure                                                              | Commitlint Error Message                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git commit -m "added login"`                                          | Invalid type. "added" is not a standard commit type.                            | `‚úñ type must be one of [build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, ...]`                      |
| `git commit -m "feat(api): add new endpoint"`                          | Invalid `scope`. "api" is not in the list defined in `.commitlintrc.json`.      | `‚úñ scope must be one of [project, activity, payment, ...]`                            |
| `git commit -m "fix(payment): ... (a very long and detailed description) ..."` | Header is longer than 72 characters, violating the `header-max-length` rule.    | `‚úñ header must not be longer than 72 characters`                                      |
| `git commit -m "fix:"`                                                 | The subject (description) after the colon is empty.                             | `‚úñ subject may not be empty`                                                          |
| `git commit -m "FIX(payment): some fix"`                               | The commit type must be in lower-case.                                          | `‚úñ type must be lower-case`                                                           |
| `git commit -m "feat: ...a very long line without line breaks..."`     | A line in the commit body exceeds the 100-character limit. Long lines must be wrapped. | `‚úñ body's lines must not be longer than 100 characters`        |
