    steps:
      # REASON: The action needs to check out the code to access repository files
      # like .commitlintrc.json and package.json.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # REASON: commitlint is a Node.js tool, so the Node.js environment is required to run it.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      # REASON: Installs commitlint and all its dependencies defined in package-lock.json.
      # 'npm ci' is faster and more reliable for CI environments than 'npm install'.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # REASON: This action runs commitlint against the PR title, enforcing Conventional Commits.
      # This is crucial because the PR title often becomes the commit message on a squash merge.
